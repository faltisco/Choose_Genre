# Choose_Genre
The purpose of this project is to help a movie producer choose which genre movie to make given they have a particular actor in mind. The data from The Movie Database was selected, and measures of success used were revenue and popularity of the movies in which that actor performed in, as well as the movie's genre. Python with Pandas Dataframes were used to clean and analyze the data. Matplotlib was used to plot the results. The statistical U Test (The Mann-WHitney, Rank Sum Test) was performed, which suffices in cases of smaller sample size, provided the samples are independent. Using the Python library scipy.stats, the result was positive in that in several cases, the analysis provided rejection of the null hypthesis that the actor's movie genre had no difference. Better results were shown when the actor had a larger body of films from which to compare.
